### Description

MAD LAD is an Android mobile application with a primary purpose of assisting users with learning Mobile App Developement concepts. Unlike your textbooks or websites such as stackoverflow, which requires searching through multiple pages to find what you are searchinng for, MAD LAD helps manage and sort out specific developement concepts for you. The only thing required from the user is an account that can be easily registered in the application itself.

### Core features

- Secure sign-in and registration
- Organized list of concepts for the user's convenience
- Easily sortable via a search bar

### Setting up / Help

Upon running the application, the user will be greeted by a [login page](https://i.imgur.com/b2qck9m.png). If the user does not have an account, they will be required to make one in the [registration page](https://i.imgur.com/SxMlXu9.png) by clicking "New user? Click here to register." in order to access the features inside the application. If the user does not remember his password, they can click "Forgot Password." and they would be redirected to [a page](https://i.imgur.com/Jh4wvC1.png) where they would be able to input their existing email, where they would then be receiving an [email with a link](https://i.imgur.com/VaYZSgE.png) to [reset the password](https://i.imgur.com/EBaWOYr.png).

Upon logging in, there will be an [introduction screen](https://i.imgur.com/UPGYtP0.png) that shows for 30 seconds. The user can choose to always skip this scene by clicking the checkbox on the bottom left hand corner.

Afterwards, there will be a [list of concepts](https://i.imgur.com/sN7yj9g.png) that the user will see. By clicking on the title of each concept, the user will be brought [onto a page](https://i.imgur.com/gDYryie.png) where he/she can learn all about the selected topic. There is also a button "Comments" at the bottom of the page where users can post comments eg. for help on a concept. There is also an option for the user to log out if they wish to.
