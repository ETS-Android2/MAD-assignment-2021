### Description

MAD LAD is an Android mobile application with a primary purpose of assisting users with learning Mobile App Developement concepts. Unlike your textbooks or websites such as stackoverflow, which requires searching through multiple pages to find what you are searchinng for, MAD LAD helps manage and sort out specific developement concepts for you. The only thing required from the user is an account that can be easily registered in the application itself.

### Core features

- Secure sign-in and registration
- Organized list of concepts for the user's convenience
- Easily sortable via a search bar

### Setting up / Help

Upon running the application, the user will be greeted by a login page. If the user does not have an account, he will be required to make one in order to access the features inside the application.

Upon logging in, there will be an introduction screen that shows for 30 seconds. The user can choose to always skip this scene by clicking the checkbox on the bottom left hand corner.

Afterwards, there will be a list of concepts that the user will see. By clicking on the title of each concept, the user will be brought onto a page where he/she can learn all about the selected topic.

There is also a comment section at the bottom of the page where users can post comments eg. for help on a concept.
